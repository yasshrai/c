# BFS and DFS Matrix/Graph Implementation in C
This Repo contains my implementation of some basic **graph** and **matrix algorithms** in C.  
I have also implemented the **queue** required for BFS.

## How to Run
1. First, create the `dist` folder in the project directory:
```bash
mkdir -p dist
```
2. Compile all source files and create the executable:
```bash
gcc -Iinclude src/*.c -o dist/example
```
3. Run the program:
```bash
./dist/example
```
